# Phish-Guard WIP   

[Phish-Guard](https://github.com/IlmHe/Phish-Guard) is a privacy-friendly, lightweight browser extension designed to detect phishing emails, URLs, and other malicious content. It operates seamlessly in the background, providing users with an easy-to-use tool to enhance their online security.  

Phishing attacks are a significant threat to online security, and many users fall victim to these attacks due to a lack of awareness or effective tools. I'm creating Phish-Guard to provide a simple yet powerful solution to help users identify and avoid phishing attempts. This is meant to be a very simple and lightweight tool, something that I find myself that I wish was already made.
